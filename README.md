Version 2.2 (Beta Version 2.2)

Some random scripts to make life easier.

## Dictionary/Vocabulary Helper
A very simple concept. Enter the words you wish to search, and select the dictionary you wish to use, and search all those words at once. I made this for vocabulary assignments.

## Changelog
### **2.2**
#### General Changes
- Added support for older browsers
- Added a warning for mobile devices that the site may not work well (it doesn't) that only appears if the user is using a mobile device
- Changed margins so text spacing is smoother
- Added cool icons for the instructions on how to enter a word list
- Added a hidden section for beta development
- Added a smaller warning style for in-text notations
- Added preferences, but only for developer use at the moment
